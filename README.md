# Data-Representation-and-Querying-2016-Project

1. Basic HTML and CSS: Created part of the basic layout for the webpage and will continue to add functionality in future commits.
2. Added Javascript slider and an image bar: Slider currently contains placeholder images and those need to be replaced, image bar images should act as buttons and redirect to proper content.
